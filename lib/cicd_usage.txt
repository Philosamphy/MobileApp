# How to use CI/CD for 3A folder

Repository URL: https://github.com/Philosamphy/MobileApp

## First time setup (if you haven't bound the repository):

   git init
   git remote add origin https://github.com/Philosamphy/MobileApp.git

1. Make sure you have git installed and your repository is cloned.
2. Add or modify files in the 3A folder as needed.
3. Use the following commands to upload your changes and trigger CI/CD:

   git add .
   git commit -m "code uploaded"
   git push origin main

# Notes
- The CI/CD workflow will be triggered automatically on GitHub after you push.
- You can check the workflow status in the Actions tab of your GitHub repository.
- If your branch is not 'main', replace 'main' with your actual branch name.
